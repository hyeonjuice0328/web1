    Usage notes[edit]
    Although worldwide is a single word (also spelt as world-wide),
     World Wide Web is spelt as three separate words.

    World Wide Web and Web are sometimes loosely used to refer to the entire
    Internet, but this is not technically accurate: the Internet includes
    further non-Web systems such as e-mail (SMTP) and newsgroups (NNTP).
